Scripts for some exercises and mini-projects in the context of DIT's 400h Bootcamp on Python, Data Visualisation, Web Scraping, Natural Language Processing, Data Engineering, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
# 400h : Python, Data Visualization, Web Scraping, Natural Language Processing, Data Engineering, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
Notebooks and scripts for exercises and mini-projects I am completing as part of Dakar Institute of Technology's Data Science Intensif Bootcamp.

# Work in progress:
"Missing" and "Incomplete" exercises will be resolved.
Most "Complete" exercises are likely to be revisited.
Feel free to branch out and provide alternate solutions!
